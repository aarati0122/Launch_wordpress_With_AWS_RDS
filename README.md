# Deploy WordPress with Amazon RDS

## Introduction: 
In this repo, we will learn how to set up a WordPress site to run. WordPress requires a MySQL database to store its data. For this,We will use Amazon RDS for MySQL to run our MySQL database.

## Wordpress :
WordPress is web publishing software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog. It just may be the easiest and most flexible blogging and website content management system (CMS) for beginners.
WordPress enables you to build and manage your own full-featured website using just your web browser—without having to learn how to code. In fact, if you’ve ever used a text editor like Microsoft Word, you’ll be right at home with the WordPress Editor.

## RDS :
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed SQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon RDS supports an array of database engines to store and organize data and helps with database management tasks, such as migration, backup, recovery and patching.

A cloud administrator uses Amazon RDS to set up, manage and scale a relational database instance in the cloud. The service also automatically backs up RDS database instances, captures a daily snapshot of data and retains transaction logs to enable point-in-time recovery. RDS also automatically patches database engine software.

## Why Use the AWS RDS:
- Database maintenance for your WordPress site is critical. Your database instance holds all of your important data for your WordPress site. If the database goes down, your  website may go down with it, and you could even lose your data.
 
- Database maintenance can also be difficult, and database administrators have years of specialized experience. When setting up a WordPress site, you want to stay focused on designing your page and generating your content, not worrying about database performance and backups.
